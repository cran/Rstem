The code is easy to make into an S-Plus chapter.  The S code does not need to be changed
other than removing the PACKAGE argument in the .Call() invocations.  The C code 
can be easily shared by R and S-Plus using the Omegahat macros.  

Please contact me if you are interested in using this package in S-Plus.
